# 🧠 n8n RAG Workflow Template

This repository contains a pre-configured **n8n JSON workflow template** designed for building and deploying a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline.

## 🔍 What is RAG?

RAG combines traditional retrieval techniques with modern language generation models. Instead of relying solely on a language model's trained knowledge, RAG enables the model to **search external sources** (like documents, databases, or APIs) and use the retrieved information to generate more accurate, relevant, and context-aware responses.

## 🧰 Workflow Overview

This n8n template includes a basic RAG setup with the following stages:

1. **Trigger** – Initiates the workflow manually or via Webhook/API.
2. **Document Search** – Queries a vector database or document storage (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, Supabase, etc.).
3. **Context Retrieval** – Extracts the top relevant documents or passages.
4. **Prompt Construction** – Assembles a final prompt for the language model (OpenAI, Hugging Face, etc.).
5. **Generation** – Calls the LLM API with the constructed prompt and retrieved context.
6. **Response Handling** – Returns the generated result via email, webhook, or frontend app.
7. **Logging (Optional)** – Logs the interaction for tracking or retraining purposes.
